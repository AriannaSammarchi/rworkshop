# Read Me

This is a repository for the upcoming R Workshop. I host the presentation, documentation, data files, and R code for the Workshop here.

There is a single presentation that covers the entirety of the workshop and a companion document for each section. You may be familiar with pdf documents which are the outputs you can read. 

What you may not be familiar is the R Markdown (Rmd) files used to generate the documents. If you download the Rmd files you can run the same code on your machine as well.

Currently I only uploaded the files related to the first session as I plan to change the second session based on attendee's feedback.
